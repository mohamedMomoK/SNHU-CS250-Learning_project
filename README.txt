Project Overview

This README file contains answers to essential questions for the Computer Science program, focusing on interpreting user needs, developing programs, and being a good team member in software development.

Essential Questions
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves engaging with users through various methods such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather insights about their requirements and preferences. Creating user stories helps by providing a clear and concise description of the user's needs, breaking down the requirements into manageable tasks, and ensuring the development team focuses on delivering value to the users.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is centered around iterative development and continuous feedback. I aim to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum, which involves regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Using tools like Jira for tracking progress and managing tasks can enhance efficiency and collaboration within the team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member involves actively contributing to the team's goals, communicating effectively, and supporting others. It means taking responsibility for tasks, collaborating to overcome challenges, and being open to feedback. In Agile environments, this includes adhering to principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
